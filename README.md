SeederSeeker Toolkit (stk)
===

Thank you for your interest in SeederSeeker toolkit. We are right now in
the process of organizing the code and documentation of our metastatic
cancer subclonal phylogenetics analysis pipeline, which will be made
available here once it's finished.

Overview
---

SeederSeeker toolkit is a collection of both documentation of pipeline best
practices and implementation of novel algorithms for revealing subclonal level
phylogenetic relationships and seeding dynamics among metastatic cancer sites
usually made available via rapid-autopsy programs. The process involves several
steps, utilizing wide range of genomic variants such as CNV, LOH and SNV to
progressively resolve subclonal phylogenetic structures in finer detail.
